# PhiLock-Q Flat Fee Blockchain

PhiLock-Q compresses every transaction into a validator-sealed capsule—embedding entropy anchors, timestamped lineage, and symbolic overlays. It eliminates gas fees, replaces them with a predictable flat fee (e.g. $0.01), and enables falsifiability, drift detection, and validator mesh propagation. Ideal for NFTs, swaps, and sovereign-grade dApps seeking audit-ready execution at 80% lower cost than legacy chains.

## Protocol Highlights
- Flat fee capsule logic
- Validator mesh propagation
- Symbolic governance overlays
- Institutional audit interface
- Fork immunity via symbolic anchoring

## Capsule Schema
See `capsule_engine/capsule_schema.json`

## Governance Model
- Flat fee: $0.01
- Validator incentives: fee + MEV + DA leasing
- Governance via archetype overlays and challenge modules
